Version: 0.99
Date: 2022-09-22
Author: Greg Gloor
Maintainer: Greg Gloor <ggloor@uwo.ca>
Description: A set of tests for compositional pathologies. Tests for coherence of correlations with \code{aIc.coherent}, compositional dominance of distance with \code{aIc.dominant}, compositional perturbation invariance with \code{aIc.perturb}and singularity of the covariation matrix with \code{aIc.singular}. Currently tests five data transformations: prop, clr, TMM, TMMwsp, and RLE.
