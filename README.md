# aIc
tests to see if high throughput sequencing datasets have compostional characteristics

The tests are mainly for distance-based pathologies. Every dataset tested: 16S rRNA gene sequencing, transcriptome, single-cell transcriptome, metatranscriptome and in-vitro selection (SELEX) displays at least one distance-based pathology that can be traced to the compositional nature of the data. 

The package contains a number of tests, and there is an in-built shiny app [aIc.runExample()] that provides a simple interface.
